## Elctron Admin Boilerplate

An Electron boilderplate for an Admin Console (with login)

An exersise in how quickly a Desktop Admin Application can be built on:

- Electron
- ReactJS
- Bootstrap

Took about 2 days in total - so quite impressive given how long tis would 
have taken even a few years back.

You'll see it looks like lots of other similar systems out there, 
this was about speed and not content/originality - but it forms an interesting basis
for a more complex system without too much extra work - i.e. this could easily 
form the 'scaffolding' for pages with business logic on (although it would be better
to improve this first in terms of best practice and quality etc)
